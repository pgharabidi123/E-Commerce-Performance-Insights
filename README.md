# E-Commerce-Performance-Insights
# Problem Statement

In today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, businesses face challenges in understanding user behavior, tracking customer journeys, and optimizing conversions. Although vast amounts of user data are generated daily through website sessions, clicks, and purchases, these raw data points often fail to provide actionable insights unless systematically analyzed.

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce user activity data collected between January 2024 – June 2024, covering three main datasets:
Users dataset – demographic and type (new vs. returning users)
Sessions dataset – time, frequency, and device details of user sessions
Actions dataset – customer interactions such as page views, product clicks, add-to-cart events, and purchases

The goal is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps answer critical business questions such as:

1. What are the overall traffic, conversion, and bounce patterns across users, devices, and geographies?
2. How do user journeys progress from page views to purchases, and where do most users drop off?
3. What are the peak hours, days, and traffic sources driving the highest engagement?
4. How do new users behave differently from returning users, and what impact does this have on cart abandonment?
5. Which countries and devices contribute the most to conversions?

By addressing these questions, the dashboard aims to enable data-driven decision making for:

1. Reducing cart abandonment
2. Improving customer acquisition and retention strategies
3. Optimizing marketing channels and traffic sources
4. Enhancing user experience across devices

# Dataset

**1. Users.csv** – Contains demographic and type information of users (new vs. returning) to analyze audience segments.

**2. Sessions.csv** – Logs details of user sessions such as timing, duration, device, and source for behavioral analysis.

**3. Actions.csv** – Tracks user interactions across the funnel (page views, clicks, add-to-cart, purchases) to measure engagement and conversions.
